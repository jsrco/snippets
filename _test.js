/**
 * Problem Solving Approach
 * 
 * Understand the Problem
 * -restate the problem in own words
 * -what are the inputs 
 * -what are the outputs
 * -can the outputs be determined from the inputs
 * -how should I lable the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem
 *  
 * Explore Concrete Examples
 * -start with simple examples
 * -progress to more complex
 * -explore examples with empty inputs 
 * -explore examples with invalid inputs
 * 
 * Break It Down
 * -explicity write down the steps you need to take
 * 
 * Solve Or Simplify
 * -try to solve and if you can't try to solve and easier part of the problem
 * 
 * Look Back and Refactor
 * -can you check the result
 * -can you derive the result differently 
 * -can you understand it at a glance
 * -can you use the result or method for another problem
 * -can you improve performance
 * -can you think of other ways of writing the code
 * -how have other people solved it
